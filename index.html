        <p>I have recently graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, which is regarded as one of the top universities in the country. During the last three semesters of my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a research project involving Time Series Analysis along with Topological Data Analysis Tools to predict the future trends of Cryptocurrency prices. This was an exciting and challenging project that required me to apply my knowledge to develop an accurate prediction model. </p><br>
        <p>I am proud to have been a member of the All-Student team that competed against over 70 teams from 33 different countries, and even more proud to have contributed significantly to our team's success. Specifically, my contribution to the project involved constructing an LSTM neural network to predict new coronavirus cases and deaths per country, which helped our team secure a well-deserved 3rd place in the <em><a href="https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/blog/2022/un-youth-hackathon.cshtml">UN Youth Hackathon</a> </em> . This early experience in research not only gave me the chance to apply my knowledge to real-world problems but also fueled my passion for research and my eagerness to pursue further research opportunities in the future.  </p>
    </p><br>
    <p>Since Fall 2022, I am a Ph.D. Researcher at Northeastern Unviersity, advised by Dr. Saiph Savage. Where I am developing recommender systems to help upgrade digital worker's conditions. </p>
